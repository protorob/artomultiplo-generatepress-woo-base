This should be done before production sees the light:

* Add an export of GeneratePress Settings
* Add the login/logout shortcode as in the other sites in case you're not using XootiX popup plugin
* Consider removing also the festi-team popup in the future
* Create a demo site
* Include the wow scripts in case someone wants them
* Create the demo store using generateblocks
