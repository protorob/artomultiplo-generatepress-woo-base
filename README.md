# Artomultiplo's GeneratePress child Theme for Woocommerce based stores

## WARNING: This is a work in progress and might not work out of the box!

**You can lurk in the code but I'm sure that if you install it right now you're going to break something.**

---- 
My starter child for generatepress woocommerce stores

**This Child Theme is made specifically for [GeneratePress](https://generatepress.com/?ref=185), so you will need to first install that theme.**

This [GeneratePress](https://generatepress.com/?ref=185) Child Theme also asumes that you haeve installed also the [GeneratePress Premium Add-ons](https://generatepress.com/premium/?ref=185).

Even if this is not strictly necessary I think that both this cart and login plugins are really nice and makes the shopping experience a bit better, but it might be a personal opinion. **There are styles in this Child Theme to target those specific plugins**

* For the Login/Signup Popup: [XootiX Login/Signup Popup](https://xootix.com/plugins/easy-login-for-woocommerce/)
* For the popup cart: [Festi-Team WooCart Pro](http://festi.team/plugins/woocommerce-cart/)

## What is this ChildTheme changing in both GeneratePress and WooCommerce?

Primarily, this child theme modifies the display of the Default Checkout and Cart Pages in order to make it better in mobile view.
